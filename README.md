# About this fork

I made some small modifications support private podcast RSS feeds. I've only tested this on one Acast feed, so use at your own peril! Oh, also, you may need to pre-download the XML. I ran into some authentication issues when trying to directly use a private Acast RSS feed URL. 

# poddl - podcast downloader
